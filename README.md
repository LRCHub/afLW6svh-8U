Last week, we went back to the crib,
did round two
I don't even know
how the hell I even found you
I got the keys to her car
and her house too
House too, house too, house too
Let's go, big rock,
iced out G-Shock
Make her rip sheet rock,
bitch, I'm stayin' under
Let's go, he hot,
get him out the teapot
Shawty want the drip-drop,
bitch, I come with thunder
(Phew, phew, phew)
Off the cranium
Got the ATM,
finna rock the stadium
Bitch, it's 8 a.m.,
the strip club Canadian
You can pay me then,

Range Rover bus (Huh)
She want it in the truck (Huh)
Okay, I'm finna fuck (Huh)
Okay, she had enough (Okay),
huh (Yeah)
Okay, she had enough (Hey)
She doin' angel dust
She wide open, huh

She puttin' it on her tongue
She says she's on the run (Ooh)
Okay, I'm on the hunt, hmm (Hmm)
Okay, I'm on the hunt, lil' shawty
I'm in H-Town,
this a hell of a vibe
I was way too geeked,
I can't come outside (Come outside)
I got two tens and she sit on my ride
It's the weekend,
yeah, she do it this time
Last week, we went back to the crib,
did round two
I don't even know
how the hell I even found you
I got the keys to her car
and her house too
House too, house too, house too
I was too geeked,
I couldn't see
I made you mad,
but you really want me
Top of the hill,
shawty out of sync
I got idea,
let's go 'head, put it in
Let's rock the boat,
I gotta rock some more
I gotta swim the sea,
I gotta catch the beach
I got a chain,
the Ritz-Carlton, Philippe
Shawty locked like it's ALYX
Let's go, big rock,
iced out G-Shock
Make her rip sheet rock,
bitch, I'm stayin' under
Let's go, he hot,
get him out the teapot
Shawty want the drip-drop,
bitch, I come with thunder
