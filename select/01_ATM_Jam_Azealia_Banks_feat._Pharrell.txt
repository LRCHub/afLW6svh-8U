Thank u darly
Buy the barry
I can admit I likes to party
I spent a grip
I swipes the cardy
When I heist, I'mma drips my pricey garmy
I'm the swami
Hyphy hip-cat
I'm "freaky-fit-that"
I could rrrrrr-ip-pap (rap)
Ice on her wrist like high-sophis-chat
When I dyke with a bitch, that's spicy! Get that!

Ayo P. Do that freaky jam on the beat
Iz you with that butter shit-that, that *bonne vie?
Did you divvy, did you double dig that?
That song sings- freaky deeky, whistle-wetter, slip that slit (that thong thing)
Hyphy-cheeky-cheddar-checker get her own cheese
That's a chicken w/ her head off
That's that bitch that won't be with her
Official with that with that whole steez
Flighty-fleety-feather-witch that whip that long weave nigga

They shootin' in the parking lot
Everybody get low
They shootin' in the parking lot
It ain't where you wanna go
Now standby soldier standby soldier
And work it with the motherfuckin' ass like I told ya
Standby soldier standby soldier
And work it with the motherfuckin' ass like I told ya

Ice the berg, white's the fur
IMS IN THE HOUSE LIKE NICE SUBURB
Pipes on her pout, might pipe the purr
Peter pipe been about my pint for sure!
Ims a mermaid, rhymes the Nurse
I'm little red ride ride theMy shimmy-shake's inside the shirt
Should a dyke and a gay guy try to flirt?
