The game fuck up
New niggas banging
Old heads complaining
Instead of passing the torch
They rather rain on my flaming
But I speak the truth with no naming
With these words I make paintings
While y'all getting at Becky
I'm trying to shoot at Amy
I'm on the internet
The modern day connect
If I write it then buy it
This brand new
Why not try it
Ha ha
I am on another level moving forward
Back peddling so absurd
Y'all sound retarded
Push button on the foreign get the engine started
This my life only right to put it in recordings
How you hustle
Digital scales getting that mail Clientele was looking for sales like it was retail
Hey
Addicted to marijuana like crack Look at his lips they black
Spent his last dub on a sack
And without hesitation I snatch it And pitch it
At the same time Before them silver badges
Roll up
Pour up
Something to make you slow up The day you blow personal
The minute that you gone grow up
I use think rapping about money was so ill
Cause I came from the struggle
Check to check pay my bills

It's about that money
Money til the day I die
It's about that money
Hustling til my well runs dry

I'm a long way from home
City lights shine so bright
Always knew I would make it Name in them flashy lights
When doctor Dre was making beats
And them headphones
I was hustling block to block slanging damn zones
Illegal searches the K9 unit in my backyard
My son was only one had a nigga paranoid
Then I dropped down on my knees
Said a prayer lord help me please Our father which art in heaven
I need you right now
Hope you receive my message I'm gone put this shit down
And concentrate on my music hit the studio hard
Have forgiveness for this sinner And some mercy now lord
I'm fiending
The streets they keep on calling me
My phone rings
Now I'm back doing the same thing
I admit that I got a problem
Sold my soul to the devil for a dollar
Raised in the church but now I don't go much
I don't go
Lot of family but now we don't stay in touch
They don't hollar
And I hope they anit looking down
What I did y'all
At the life I choose to get off the ground

It's about that money
Money til the day I die
It's about that money
Hustling til my well runs dry
