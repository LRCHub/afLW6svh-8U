Touch my hair and your fucking dead
My bicep is twice the size of your head
I go to the gym 6 days a week
I'm on the juice, I'm at my peak
I go out at night, with the guys
Anyone that fucks with us just dies
Take no shit from anyone
At least one of us always carries a gun
You could see us pumping the 6 by 9's
In a done-up Gemini they always recognize
Chrome hub-caps and a new paintjob
Perfect getaway car when we need to rob
A house or two, just to get by
Drug prices going up, less people getting high
I know the reason cops pick on me
"It's discrimination mate, ------- ethnicity

It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic
It's getting, it's getting, it's getting kinda hectic

I have long hair, I tie it back
Wear tracksuit pants and an Everlast hat
I never smile, I always sounds pissed
It's more intimidating when I speak with a lisp
I do anything to raught the system
---- up in prison
But its alright, it's worth it in the end
When I role some dickhead at the ATM

All my ex-girlfriends hate my guts
But I don't give a shit because they're all sluts
My last one wanted to be a surgeon
But get this the bitch wasn't even a virgin
I wear tight tops that make me look bigger
So all the chicks can admire my figure
Ten gold chains and seven phones
With 101 different mobile ring tones
You can see us hanging out in the car-park
Trying to find an old person to role in the dark
Baseball bats and a rifle gun
We take all their money and then fucking run
Before the cops get the call in the middle of the night
We count all the money and everything is alright
We try and swear in any situations
It's all a part of the intimidation

I have long hair, I tie it back
Wear tracksuit pants and an Everlast hat
I never smile, I always sounds pissed
It's more intimidating when I speak with a lisp
I do anything to raught the system
---- up in prison
But its alright, it's worth it in the end
When I role some dickhead at the ATM

Style my sideburns all the way
So they connect with the tips of my goatay
Shave the sides to a number one
Get my tips dyed blonde by the barber's son
He makes some mistakes but I don't mind
He's the cheapest hairstylist that I can find
For ten bucks you can get your way
If it's any more, I refuse to pay
If they argue, I just take out my knife
Steal the money from the till and run for my life
Down the street to the nearest bar
And thinks of ways to spend it all on my car
New lights, new rims so much to choose
Fuck, I hate being so damn confused
It's gotta be something fucking sick
So me and the boys can impress the chicks

I have long hair, I tie it back
Wear tracksuit pants and an Everlast hat
I never smile, I always sounds pissed
It's more intimidating when I speak with a lisp
I do anything to raught the system
---- up in prison
But its alright, it's worth it in the end
When I role some dickhead at the ATM

Haha, oh that GST has fucked us
What's GST?
It's a car you dickhead
Haha
That little Johnny Howard
That little Johnny Howard
If I had a crowbar I'd do it for 50 bucks
30 bucks
20 bucks
I'll do it for 5 cents!
Fuck it, i'll do it for free!
Haha
